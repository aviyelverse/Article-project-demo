# TypeScript

<p class="description">
  You can add static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and
  code quality thanks to TypeScript.

### Minimum configuration

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

MUI requires a minimum version of TypeScript 3.5. Have a look at the [Create React App with TypeScript](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript) example.

For types to work, it's recommended that you have at least the following options enabled in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": ["es6", "dom"],
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true
  }
}
```

The strict mode options are the same that are required for every types package
published in the `@types/` namespace.
Using a less strict `tsconfig.json` or omitting some of the libraries might cause errors.
To get the best type experience with the types we recommend setting `"strict": true`.

### Handling `value` and event handlers

Many components concerned with user input offer a `value` prop or event handlers
which include the current `value`. In most situations that `value` is only handled
within React which allows it be of any type, such as objects or arrays.

However, that type cannot be verified at compile time in situations where it depends
on the component's children e.g. for `Select` or `RadioGroup`. This means that
the soundest option is to type it as `unknown` and let the developer decide
how they want to narrow that type down. We do not offer the possibility to use a generic
type in those cases for [the same reasons `event.target` is not generic in React](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/11508#issuecomment-256045682).

The demos include typed variants that use type casting. It is an acceptable tradeoff
because the types are all located in a single file and are very basic. You have to decide for yourself
if the same tradeoff is acceptable for you. The library types are strict
by default and loose via opt-in.
