#### Installation

<p class="description">
  Install MUI, the world's most popular React UI framework.
</p>

MUI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material).

#### npm

To install and save in your `package.json` dependencies, run:

```sh
// with npm
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled

// with yarn
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

<!-- #react-peer-version -->

Please note that [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) >= 17.0.0 and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) >= 17.0.0 are peer dependencies.

MUI is using [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) as a styling engine by default. If you want to use [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com/) instead, run:

```sh
// with npm
npm install @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components

// with yarn
yarn add @mui/material @mui/styled-engine-sc styled-components
```

> üí° Take a look at the [Styled Engine guide](/guides/styled-engine/) for more information about how to configure `styled-components` as the style engine.

#### Roboto font

MUI was designed with the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
font in mind. So be sure to follow [these instructions](/components/typography/#general).
For instance, via Google Web Fonts:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
/>
```

#### Font icons

To use the font `Icon` component, you must first add the [Material icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) font.
Here are [some instructions](/components/icons/#font-icons)
on how to do so.
For instance, via Google Web Fonts:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
/>
```

#### SVG icons

In order to use prebuilt SVG Material icons, such as those found in the [icons demos](/components/icons/)
you must first install the [@mui/icons-material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/icons-material) package:

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

```sh
// with npm
npm install @mui/icons-material

// with yarn
yarn add @mui/icons-material
```

#### CDN

You can start using MUI with minimal Front-end infrastructure,
which is great for prototyping.

Two Universal Module Definition (**UMD**) files are provided:

- one for development: https://unpkg.com/@mui/material@latest/umd/material-ui.development.js
- one for production: https://unpkg.com/@mui/material@latest/umd/material-ui.production.min.js

You can follow [this CDN example](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/cdn) to quickly get started.

‚ö†Ô∏è Using this approach in **production** is **discouraged** though -
the client has to download the entire library, regardless of which components are actually used,
affecting performance and bandwidth utilization.

‚ö†Ô∏è The UMD links are using the `latest` tag to point to the latest version of the library.
This pointer is **unstable**, it shifts as we release new versions.
You should consider pointing to a specific version, such as [v5.0.0](https://unpkg.com/@mui/material@5.0.0/umd/material-ui.development.js).

A set of reusable components for design tools is available, designed to match the React components and to help you craft great products:

- [Figma](https://mui.com/store/items/figma-react/): A large UI kit with over 600 handcrafted MUI components.
- [Adobe XD](https://mui.com/store/items/adobe-xd-react/): A large UI kit with over 600 handcrafted MUI components.
- [Sketch](https://mui.com/store/items/sketch-react/): A large UI kit with over 600 handcrafted MUI symbols.
- [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/merge/mui-library): A large UI kit of MUI components. The design tool renders the components in a web runtime. It uses the same React implementation as your production environment.
