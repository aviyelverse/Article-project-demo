#### Learn MUI

<p class="description">
  New to MUI? It's easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will
  help you to get started quickly.
</p>

Developers come to MUI from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or practical approach, we hope you'll find this section helpful.
Like any unfamiliar technology, MUI does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will soon get the hang of it.

#### First example

The [usage page](/getting-started/usage/#quick-start) contains a small MUI example with a live editor.
Even if you don't know anything about MUI yet, try changing the code and see how it affects the result.

#### Example projects

There are [some example projects](/getting-started/example-projects/) available, providing the infrastructure needed to develop and deploy websites in React.

#### Templates

This [selection of basic templates](/getting-started/templates/) will help you get started building your app.

#### Recommended resources

> ⚠️ Note that the resources linked below are using MUI v4, which is not the latest major version. As v5 has been released recently, it will take some time till new contents are created. If you have created any learning material for v5, let us know and we can link them here.

When first learning MUI, you might find third-party blog posts, books and video courses more helpful than the official documentation.
Here are some recommended resources, some of which are free.
