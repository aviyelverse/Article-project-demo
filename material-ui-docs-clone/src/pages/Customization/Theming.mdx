# Theming

<p class="description">
  Customize MUI with your theme. You can change the colors, the typography and
  much more.
</p>

The theme specifies the color of the components, darkness of the surfaces, level of shadow, appropriate opacity of ink elements, etc.

Themes let you apply a consistent tone to your app. It allows you to **customize all design aspects** of your project in order to meet the specific needs of your business or brand.

To promote greater consistency between apps, light and dark theme types are available to choose from. By default, components use the light theme type.

### Theme provider

If you wish to customize the theme, you need to use the `ThemeProvider` component in order to inject a theme into your application.
However, this is optional; MUI components come with a default theme.

`ThemeProvider` relies on the [context feature of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to pass the theme down to the components, so you need to make sure that `ThemeProvider` is a parent of the components you are trying to customize.
You can learn more about this in [the API section](#themeprovider).

### Theme configuration variables

Changing the theme configuration variables is the most effective way to match MUI to your needs.
The following sections cover the most important theme variables:

- [`.palette`](/customization/palette/)
- [`.typography`](/customization/typography/)
- [`.spacing`](/customization/spacing/)
- [`.breakpoints`](/customization/breakpoints/)
- [`.zIndex`](/customization/z-index/)
- [`.transitions`](/customization/transitions/)
- [`.components`](/customization/theme-components/)

You can check out the [default theme section](/customization/default-theme/) to view the default theme in full.
