</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

### Basic button group

The buttons can be grouped by wrapping them with the `ButtonGroup` component.
They need to be immediate children.

### Button variants

All the standard button variants are supported.

### Sizes and colors

The `size` and `color` props can be used to control the appearance of the button group.

### Vertical group

The button group can be displayed vertically using the `orientation` prop.

### Split button

`ButtonGroup` can also be used to create a split button. The dropdown can change the button action (as in this example) or be used to immediately trigger a related action.

### Disabled elevation

You can remove the elevation with the `disableElevation` prop.
